# Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a Version Control System (VCS) used in a huge amount of projects, not only open-source but also private and in the industry. It works by creating "snapshots" of your files, so you can share them with others or come back to an old version if something is not working right. It allows efficient cooperative work and a traceable lifecycle for software projects, which is a great advantage for developers.
